    <h1>Server Rules</h1>
    <p class="rules">- No racism, sexism, homophobic, or xenophobia of any caliber. This includes calling someone slurs and making up rumors that<br>
    someone is oneof these. Punishments will be exercised Production's discretion, but these will usually result in an instant ejection.
<br>- No communicating with the Spectators about the game in any capacity. Of course this includes 'alting' as well. Your conversations about the game should remain between Production and Castaways.
<br>- Using past gameshows or ORGs as criteria to get someone voted out, otherwise known as 'metagaming', is strictly prohibited. We're all just here to have fun, and that kills it. Keep your drama elsewhere.
<br>- Of course, we have 0 tolerance for cheating in this ORG. If there's even a slight chance that we feel someone is cheating, an investigation will commence.
<br>- If you try to argue and complain to Production about something not going your way, the response you will receive in return will be "Go cry about it." If we make a mistake, we'll fix it. If nothing is fixed, there is no mistake. It's as simple as that. Take the loss and move on.</p>
    <h1>Confessionals and Submissions</h1>
    <p class="rules">In this ORG, you will have 2 separate chats that you can spill everything in. Your Confessional chat and your Submission chat.</p>
    <h2>Confessionals</h2>
    <p class="rules">This should just be used for anything and everything you have to say about the game! Confessionals, rants, streams of thought, whatever floats your boat. You can also request Alliance Chats in here, but more information will be in the 'Alliances' category.
<br>You MUST make at least one confessional per game cycle. These are used to give us Hosts and Spectators some insight on your position in the game, so don't let us down!</p>
    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    <p class="rules">This chat will be closed off to normal spectators. Only Production and VIP Spectators will be able to see this chat. Challenge submissions, votes, and extremely sensitive game information should go here. You may also choose to search for an Immunity Idol here. Idols and Advantages will be placed here, should you stumble upon one.</p>
