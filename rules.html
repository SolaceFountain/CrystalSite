    <h1>Server Rules</h1>
    <p class="rules">- No racism, sexism, homophobic, or xenophobia of any caliber. This includes calling someone slurs and making up rumors that<br>
    someone is oneof these. Punishments will be exercised Production's discretion, but these will usually result in an instant ejection.
<br>- No communicating with the Spectators about the game in any capacity. Of course this includes 'alting' as well. Your conversations about the game should remain between Production and Castaways.
<br>- Using past gameshows or ORGs as criteria to get someone voted out, otherwise known as 'metagaming', is strictly prohibited. We're all just here to have fun, and that kills it. Keep your drama elsewhere.
<br>- Of course, we have 0 tolerance for cheating in this ORG. If there's even a slight chance that we feel someone is cheating, an investigation will commence.
<br>- If you try to argue and complain to Production about something not going your way, the response you will receive in return will be "Go cry about it." If we make a mistake, we'll fix it. If nothing is fixed, there is no mistake. It's as simple as that. Take the loss and move on.</p>
    <h1>Confessionals and Submissions</h1>
    <p class="rules">In this ORG, you will have 2 separate chats that you can spill everything in. Your Confessional chat and your Submission chat.</p>
    <h2>Confessionals</h2>
    <p class="rules">This should just be used for anything and everything you have to say about the game! Confessionals, rants, streams of thought, whatever floats your boat. You can also request Alliance Chats in here, but more information will be in the 'Alliances' category.
<br>You MUST make at least one confessional per game cycle. These are used to give us Hosts and Spectators some insight on your position in the game, so don't let us down!</p>
    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    <p class="rules">This chat will be closed off to normal spectators. Only Production and VIP Spectators will be able to see this chat. Challenge submissions, votes, and extremely sensitive game information should go here. You may also choose to search for an Immunity Idol here. Idols and Advantages will be placed here, should you stumble upon one.</p>
    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <p class="rules">As you know, challenges occur once or twice every cycle. There are 4 main types of challenges that we like to use here at JaisORGS:
<br>- App Challenges (sparringly)
<br>- Hero Challenges
<br>- Live Challenges
<br>- Teamwork Challenges
<br>If you are submitting a challenge from your COMPUTER, make sure to take a screenshot of your ENTIRE screen. We must be able to see date and time, as well as your name written in the search bar.
<br>If you are submitting a challenge from MOBILE, make sure to have the time in the screenshot.
<br>You are allowed 3 ABSTAINS the entire Season. These will allow you to bypass challenges without receiving a strike. Failure to complete a challenge without abstaining before the deadline will result in a strike.</p>
    <h1>Alliances</h1>
    <p class="rules">You may request Alliances via Confessional Chat. Just let us know who you'd like to be part of it, as well as the name of the chat. If it's a 1 on 1 chat, it can take place in DMs. 
<br>You do not have to ping us each time you request an Alliance! We've got eyes on the server almost every hour of the day, so don't feel the need to ping unless hours have gone by without the chat being made.</p>
    <h1>Tribal Council</h1>
    <p class="rules">Tribal Council will occur after each challenge. You will have 24 hours to vote from the beginning of Tribal Council.
<br>You must also make a parchment, using the !parchment command. If you are unable to make a parchment, please let a Host know or use the command c!cp. Further instructions for that command will follow.
<br>You will be given a Tribal Council question, courtesy of one of the Hosts. You don't have to answer truthfully, but it is asked that you do answer your question.
<br>When you submit your vote, you must define whether it is a placeholder or locked in. You cannot change your vote if it is locked, but you can if it is a placeholder. Votes will be read 24 hours after the beginning of Tribal Council, unless everyone locks in, in which case votes will be read as soon as all votes are locked.</p>
