    <h1>Server Rules</h1>
    <p>- No racism, sexism, homophobic, or xenophobia of any caliber. This includes calling someone slurs and making up rumors that<br>
    someone is one of these. Punishments will be exercised Production's discretion, but these will usually result in an instant ejection.
- No communicating with the Spectators about the game in any capacity. Of course this includes 'alting' as well. Your conversations<br>
about the game should remain between Production and Castaways.
- Using past gameshows or ORGs as criteria to get someone voted out, otherwise known as 'metagaming', is strictly prohibited.<br>
We're all just here to have fun, and that kills it. Keep your drama elsewhere.
- Of course, we have 0 tolerance for cheating in this ORG. If there's even a slight chance that we feel someone is cheating<br>
, an investigation will commence.
- If you try to argue and complain to Production about something not going your way, the response you will receive in return <br>
will be "Go cry about it." If we make a mistake, we'll fix it. If nothing is fixed, there is no mistake. It's as simple as that. <br>
Take the loss and move on.</p>
